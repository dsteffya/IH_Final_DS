#  Climate Change Influence on Grape Wine Production in California
Introduction
- A big deal in the wine industry is that wine growers and viticulturalists had have trouble producing certain grapes for wine due to the changes in weather. With - the shifting of the seasons, grape vine and many other perennials have had their natural growth cycles thrown off by warmer weather and drastic temperature fluctuations. Warmer weather typically means spring so grape vines come out of dormancy, but if it gets cold again, they donâ€™t make it.
- California hosts some of the world's largest wine companies and it produces 90 percent of American-made wine. It also supplies more than 60 percent of all wine consumed in the country.
- In this project, we took a look at the yearly grape yield of California by grape varietal and county, then compared it with yearly and monthly temperatures, precipitation, and ozone levels. We also did an analysis of temperature and precipitation on the month of January for dormant season. Finally, linear regression model was applied to predict the wine grape production for the future.
